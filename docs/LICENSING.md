# Licensing

## Project license

FastAPI-RS has selected **MIT** for its independently written code. The license
text is in [`LICENSE.md`](../LICENSE.md), and MIT is declared in the Cargo
workspace and Python package metadata. Both Cargo crates package that file via
`license-file`. The notice identifies FastAPI-RS contributors and 2026. This
license does not relicense FastAPI, Starlette, Pydantic, or third-party
material.

## Upstream and dependency material

- FastAPI 0.141.1 is MIT-licensed. FastAPI source is not copied into this
  repository; if any covered material is added later, preserve its notice.
- The selected Starlette compatibility contract is 1.6.0 (BSD-3-Clause).
  Starlette-RS is a separate BSD-3-Clause project and remains a distinct
  dependency with its own notices.
- Pydantic 2.13.4 and `pydantic-core` 2.46.4 are MIT-licensed in the selected
  oracle environment. Pydantic remains an independent runtime dependency.
- The locked Rust workspace dependency graph, its licenses, enabled features,
  and dependency edges are inventoried in
  [`RUST_TARGET_DEPENDENCIES.md`](RUST_TARGET_DEPENDENCIES.md). The FastAPI
  source dependency graph is documented separately in
  [`DEPENDENCIES.md`](DEPENDENCIES.md).

## Release gate

Before publishing, record whether each component is independently authored,
copied, generated, or bundled; resolve and review the Cargo and Python
distribution dependency graphs; and include the applicable notices and license
texts in source and binary distributions. Upstream tests, docs, examples, and
branding must be reviewed separately. Verify licenses for the versions that
are actually shipped, rather than relying on current branch metadata.

The project should identify itself as an independent implementation and avoid
implying endorsement by FastAPI, Starlette, or Pydantic. This is an engineering
checklist, not legal advice; seek counsel for a definitive derivative-work,
trademark, or distribution determination.
